XG Gold Robot MT5 is an expert advisor developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to optimize gold trading on the MetaTrader 5 platform. This README file provides an overview of the code structure and functionality of the XG Gold Robot MT5.

## How it Works

The XG Gold Robot MT5 utilizes several customizable parameters to execute buy and sell trades in the gold market. These parameters include:

- **Risk Percentage**: Determines the percentage of the account balance to risk for each trade.
- **Stop Loss**: Sets the stop loss level in pips.
- **Take Profit**: Sets the take profit level in pips.
- **Trailing Stop**: Sets the trailing stop level in pips.

The expert advisor uses custom indicators, namely 'XG_Gold_Indicator', 'Custom_Indicator_1', and 'Custom_Indicator_2', to determine the conditions for entering buy or sell trades. The actual buy and sell conditions need to be implemented in the `checkBuyConditions()` and `checkSellConditions()` functions.

Once the conditions are met, the expert advisor calculates the lot size based on the risk percentage and executes the trade with the specified stop loss and take profit levels. If a trade is in profit, the expert advisor modifies the stop loss level to the trailing stop level.
